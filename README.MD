Survival Essentials is a Minecraft mod that makes survival maps/servers a bit more easy for the player by giving a way to upgrade tools from wood to netherite, giving more ways to get leather and paper so the player can make books and bookshelves a bit faster and by giving a set of wood armor just so players can have a decent set of armor at the start of their adventure. 
More features to be implemented soon, including a set of redstone tools and armor. 

Note: Items names, textures and recipes are WIP(Work in Progress)
